## 1. Prerequisites
*   An **AWS Account** (Free Tier eligible).
*   A **GitHub Account** with the `Viramah-main` code uploaded.
*   A **Domain Name** (purchased from any registrar like GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.).
*   Your **Supabase keys** (URL and Anon/Service Role keys).

---

## Phase 1: GitHub Alignment
Before you click anything in AWS, ensure your code is "Production Ready":
1.  Open your terminal in the project folder.
2.  Run `npm run build`. If it fails locally, it will fail on AWS. **Fix all errors first.**
3.  Commit and Push:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "chore: production readiness and seo optimizations"
    git push origin main
    ```

---

## Phase 2: AWS App Connection
1.  Log in to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).
2.  Type **Amplify** in the search bar and click it.
3.  Click **"Create new app"** (Top right).
4.  Choose **GitHub** and click "Next".
5.  **Authorize**: A popup will appear. Give AWS permission to see your repositories.
6.  **Select Repository**: Choose `Viramah-main`.
7.  **Select Branch**: Choose `main`. Click Next.

---

## Phase 3: The Build Settings
*This is where most people make mistakes. Follow these exactly:*

1.  **App Name**: `Viramah-Live`.
2.  **Environment Variables**: Click the "Advanced Settings" dropdown.
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: (Paste your URL)
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: (Paste your Anon Key)
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: `https://yourdomain.com`
3.  **Build Spec**: Amplify usually auto-detects it. If it asks, ensure it looks like this:
    ```yaml
    version: 1
    frontend:
      phases:
        preBuild:
          commands:
            - npm ci
        build:
          commands:
            - npm run build
      artifacts:
        baseDirectory: .next
        files:
          - '**/*'
      cache:
        paths:
          - node_modules/**/*
    ```
4.  Click **Save and Deploy**. Wait about 5 minutes for the green checkmarks.

## Phase 4: Domain Connection (The Free Way)
*Warning: Do NOT use AWS Route 53 if you want to stay 100% free.*

1.  In the left sidebar of Amplify, click **Domain management**.
2.  Click **Add domain**.
3.  Type your domain (e.g., `viramah.com`) and click **Configure domain**.
4.  **Subdomains**: It will automatically suggest `www` and `root`. Keep them.
5.  **DNS Manual Setup**:
    *   Amplify will provide 3 specific records. For your domain `viramahstay.com`, they look like this:
    
| Type | Hostname | Value / Points To |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CNAME | `_8e5...` | `_ca17...acm-validations.aws.` |
| ANAME/ALIAS | `@` | `d2z2gp43a2adi9.cloudfront.net` |
| CNAME | `www` | `d2z2gp43a2adi9.cloudfront.net` |

    *   **Action**: Go to your domain provider -> DNS Management -> Add these records.
    *   **Note**: In the Hostname field, only paste the random string (e.g., `_8e55...`), **not** the `.viramahstay.com.` part.
6.  **Wait**: DNS changes can take 10 minutes to 24 hours (usually 30 mins).

## Phase 5: Performance & SEO Validation
Once the site is live at your domain:
1.  **Check 404**: Visit `yourdomain.com/this-path-does-not-exist` to see your custom premium 404 page.
2.  **Check Sitemap**: Visit `yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`. It should show all your pages.
3.  **Check Meta Tags**: View page source (`Ctrl+U`) and look for your keywords in the `<meta>` tags.
4.  **Mobile Test**: Open the site on your phone. It should feel like a native app thanks to the `manifest.ts` we added.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting Common Issues
*   **Build Fails (Memory)**: Next.js builds can sometimes exceed the free tier memory. If this happens, I can help you add a "memory swap" script to your build settings.
*   **SSL Pending**: If your SSL says "Pending" for more than 2 hours, it means your TXT or CNAME record is incorrect at your registrar. Double-check the spelling!
